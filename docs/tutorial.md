Minesweeper is a game in which mines are hidden in a grid of squares. Safe squares display a number indicating the number of mines adjacent to the square, and you use these clues to solve the game by opening all safe squares. If you click on a mine, you immediately lose. 

You can open squares with the left mouse button and place flags on suspected mines with the right mouse button. When you open a square that touches no adjacent mines, it will appear blank and adjacent squares will automatically open in all directions until numbered squares are reached. If you flag every mine around a numbered square, left clicking that number will uncover its remaining neighbors; however, if you place the correct number of flags incorrectly, left clicking would trigger the mine.

The three preset difficulty levels are:

 - Beginner (9x9 with 10 mines)
 - Intermediate (12x20 with 40 mines)
 - Expert (30x16 with 99 mines). 
 
You also can play Custom games up to 30x60, with at least 10 mines and at most 40% of the board (or 499 mines, whichever is lower). The game ends when all safe squares have been uncovered. A counter displays the number of unflagged mines, and a clock records your elapsed time in seconds.
